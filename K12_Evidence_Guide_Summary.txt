K-12 GUIDE TO EVALUATING EVIDENCE — COMPLETE SUMMARY

This guide outlines how the K–12 team should evaluate evidence to inform strategic decisions. It expands the definition of evidence beyond academic quantitative research to include stories, observations, and community input. Evidence is any information used to inform decisions. A single piece of evidence does not need to meet every criterion; instead, a body of evidence should compensate for weaknesses in individual pieces.

Evidence is evaluated along:
- Quality (Research Design, Credibility, Relevance)
- Impact
- Body of Evidence Maturity

Quality and impact are considered “high” only when evidence supports priority populations (Black, Latino, and students experiencing poverty) and is relevant to strategy.

----------------------------------------
1. INDIVIDUAL EVIDENCE RATINGS
----------------------------------------

Evidence is rated as: Blue, Green, Yellow, or Red.

Each rating considers:
- Research Design
- Credibility
- Relevance
- Impact
- Overall Reviewer Judgment (not an average)

----------------------------------------
BLUE — Highest Quality Evidence
----------------------------------------
Research Design:
- Meta-analysis or well-designed experimental study
- Appropriate method, sufficient power and duration

Credibility (must meet all 3):
1. Credible third-party
2. Peer reviewed or reputable publication
3. Addresses participant context and researcher positionality

Relevance (must meet all 4):
1. Disaggregated by race/income
2. Representative of priority populations
3. Timely (within 10 years)
4. Relevant context (U.S. public schools)

Impact:
- Medium or large impact on priority populations
- Effect sizes: <0.05 Small; 0.05–0.20 Medium; ≥0.20 Large

----------------------------------------
GREEN — Moderate to Strong Evidence
----------------------------------------
Research Design:
- Well-designed quasi-experimental study
- Treatment/comparison groups and implementation measures ideal

Credibility (meets 2 of 3):
- Credible third-party
- Peer reviewed/reputable
- Acknowledges positionality/context

Relevance (meets 3 of 4):
- Representative of priority populations
- Prioritizes outcomes for priority populations
- Timely
- Relevant context

Impact:
- Modest impact on priority populations OR
- Medium/large impact on general population

----------------------------------------
YELLOW — Limited or Weaker Evidence
----------------------------------------
Research Design:
- Correlational studies
- Qualitative studies
- Meta-analyses/experiments with methodological concerns

Credibility (meets 1 of 3):
- Credible third-party OR
- Peer reviewed/reputable OR
- Considers context/positionality

Relevance (meets 2 of 4):
- Representative
- Prioritizes priority populations
- Timely
- Relevant context

Impact:
- Modest impact on general population, not priority populations

----------------------------------------
RED — Low or Unacceptable Evidence
----------------------------------------
Research Design:
- Does not meet quality standards (small sample, insufficient power, short duration, poor generalizability)

Credibility:
- Meets 0 of 3 criteria

Relevance:
- Meets 1 or fewer of 4 criteria

Impact:
- No or negative impact

----------------------------------------
2. GLOSSARY OF STUDY TYPES
----------------------------------------
Experimental Study:
- Tests causal relationships using random assignment

Quasi-Experimental Study:
- Attempts causal inference without full experimental control

Correlational Study:
- Examines relationships; does not determine causation

Qualitative/Foundational Research:
- Explores experiences, social processes, subjective factors

----------------------------------------
3. BODY OF EVIDENCE MATURITY LEVELS
----------------------------------------

MATURE:
- Fully addresses all dimensions
- Team confident in outcomes and equity considerations

LIMITED:
- Addresses most dimensions
- Some unanswered questions remain

EMERGING:
- Some supporting evidence exists
- Major gaps remain in populations, outcomes, or rigor

EARLY:
- Very little external evidence
- Based on hypothesis needing validation
