The study involved 500 students across 10 schools using an AI-powered reading platform for 12 weeks. Results showed:\n\n- 15-point average improvement in standardized reading comprehension scores\n- Largest gains observed in students reading below grade level (d=0.58)\n- High student engagement with adaptive difficulty levels\n- Teachers reported time savings of 3-5 hours per week on assessment and progress monitoring\n\nKey findings:\n1. Personalized instruction adapted to individual student needs in real-time\n2. Immediate feedback helped students correct misconceptions\n3. Data dashboards helped teachers identify struggling students early\n4. Implementation fidelity was high (87% daily usage)\n\nLimitations: Study focused on grades 3-5, suburban schools with adequate technology infrastructure. Generalizability to other contexts requires further research."

Overall effect size: d=0.42 (95% CI: 0.31-0.53), indicating moderate positive effects.\n\nFindings by intervention type:\n- Intelligent tutoring systems: d=0.51 (strongest effects)\n- Automated feedback tools: d=0.38\n- AI-powered assessment: d=0.29\n- Adaptive reading platforms: d=0.45\n\nModerator analysis revealed:\n- Implementation duration matters: Studies >8 weeks showed larger effects (d=0.52) vs shorter duration (d=0.28)\n- Grade level differences: Stronger effects in elementary (d=0.48) vs middle/high school (d=0.35)\n- Effect sizes comparable to human tutoring (d=0.45) when implementation fidelity is high\n\nConclusions: AI tools show promise but effectiveness depends on proper implementation, teacher training, and sustained use."
