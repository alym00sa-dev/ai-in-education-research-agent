The study design is qualitative, synthesizing existing research and anecdotal evidence from educators. Key outcomes include increased student confidence, participation, and self-efficacy when acceleration strategies are used. The main finding direction is positive, suggesting that acceleration helps struggling students engage more effectively with grade-level content and improves their academic self-concept.",
